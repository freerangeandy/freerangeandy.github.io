      <h1>Andy Lee</h1>
      <p>I'm a recent graduate of the Launch Academy boot camp with 7 years of prior software development experience - and a few years as a high school teacher sandwiched in-between. My favorite coding hobbies are building single-page web apps in JavaScript, trying out new 3rd-party APIs or libraries, and taking online courses in a new language.</p>
